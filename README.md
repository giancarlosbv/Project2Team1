Spark Covid Data Analysis

For this project, we used Scala, Spark, Hive and HDFS in order to filter through an incredibly large piece of batch COVID data. In our project, we show how quickly and easily data can be parsed utilizing the mentioned technologies. We gained comfort in working collaboratively with other programmers in a timely fashion, through the use of the AGILE Scrum methodology as well as git and github.
